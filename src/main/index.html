    <h1>Classes in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Although JS does not require the developer to leverage classes in the same way that many other languages do,
        they are still available for leveraging Object Oriented Programming. This will help you to encapsulate logic
        or structured data that may need to be repeated across many different entities on your site into "classes"
        and "objects" - the class defining how the object should function, such as what fields (data) or methods
        (functions are usually called 'methods' when they relate to a specific object.)
    </p>
    <p>In this lab, you will be tasked with modifying a class, 'Lightbulb', such that other parts of your site can 
        access an individual Lightbulb's fields and methods. Once this is done, information regarding a specific
        lightbulb may be displayed on the site every time you click one of the below buttons.
    </p>
    <div id = "container"></div>
    <button id = "onBulb">create a new 'on' bulb</button>
    <button id = "offBulb">create a new 'off' bulb</button>
    <p>Note: is nothing appearing when you click a button? You should check your browser's console output. Most likely,
        the method you need to write to solve the lab has not been written yet, or was written incorrectly.
